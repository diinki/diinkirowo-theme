The diinkirowo theme is a multi-theme theme extension, featuring High-contrast, Pastel, and
well color-coded dark themes by [me](https://twitter.com/diinkiwiinki)

This theme will see many changes and updates and also additions in the future.

The theme also features color-tokens for nearly all languages, so the theme should work well with everything from HTML to Rust.
